## The aim of this experiment is to 
***
1. Study $\text{z}$-transform 

2. Understanding $\text{z}$-transform and LTI systems

3. Application of $\text{z}$-transform for system analysis – Causality and stability  

4. Filter design using placement of poles & zeros – Low pass filter, High pass filter
